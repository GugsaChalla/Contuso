# Node.js Shopping Cart Via Stripe API

Cloned a repository to obtain the starter code for this project. It included the html and css files as well as some starter Javascript code. I added the details to the store page, as well as set up the Stripe API to enable transactions. Also, I made changes to the html and css files to make the site mimic an auto-parts store which I called Contuso.
